"""LLM-facing tool surface for long-term projects.

One consolidated tool (`manage_projects`) with an action dispatch,
matching the pattern used by `manage_tasks`, `knowledge_base`, and
`file_system`. The handler operates against a ``ProjectStore`` that
lives on ``context.project_store`` and mutates ``context.current_project_id``
as a side effect of ``switch`` / ``create`` / ``exit``.

Actions:
    create / list / get / switch / exit / update / delete / resume
    task_add / task_update / task_decompose / task_next / task_list
    artifact_add / event_log / promote_from_context
